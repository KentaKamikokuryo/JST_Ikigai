Open Anaconda prompt in Pycharm

Be sure that Ikigai environment is activated

run the following command: pip install openvino-dev[tensorflow2,onnx]

run the following command to verify the installation: mo -h
If you get no error message, that's good.

run the following command: benchmark_app -h
If you get no error message, that's good.

run the following command: python -c "from openvino.inference_engine import IECore"
If you get no error message, that's good.

run the following command to find the path to OpenVino on your compute: python -c "import os,sys;print(os.path.dirname(sys.executable))"
Copy paste the path.

run the following command to setup the path in windows: set PATH="your_path_here"\Lib\site-packages\openvino\libs;%PATH%
"your_path_here" need to be replace with the previously copied path

Optional: seems useful to run Jupyter Notebook found on OpenVino repository.
run the following command: pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Have a look at the folder OpenVinoModels, OpenVinoData and OpenVinoScripts
This is where I am testing OpenVino with Python. 
Try to run them and see if they work.

That's all
